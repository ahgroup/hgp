# `hgp: HandelGroupPackage`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

`hgp` is a package for storing utility functions for use across
handelgroup. Right now, `hgp` only contains a `ggplot2` theme. But we
will update this description as we add more stuff.

**Because this repo is public, absolutely NO sensitive or confidential
information should be stored here. This repo is strictly for shared
utilities.**

## Installation

You can install the development version of hgp from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ahgroup/hgp")
```

Or if you are in a repository with `renv` enabled (recommended):

``` r
renv::install("ahgroup/hgp")
```

## Using the `ggplot2` theme

If you have a `ggplot2` plot already created, you can add an `hgp` theme
to it in the same way as any other theme

``` r
library(ggplot2)
## basic example code
ggplot(mtcars) +
    aes(x = wt, y = mpg) +
    geom_point() +
    hgp::theme_ms()
```

You can also implement an `hgp` theme at the global (script) level.
After executing this code, all `ggplot` objects you produce afterwards
will use this theme.

``` r
ggplot2::theme_set(hgp::theme_ms())
```

## Contributions

- If you contribute to `hgp`, please follow the following steps.
- We recommend referring to the appropriate section(s) in [R Packages,
  2e](https://r-pkgs.org/) for any confusing steps.
- Ensure that you run `usethis::git_vaccinate()` on every local
  environment (typically new machine) that you intend to edit this
  package on. This helps to prevent leakage of PII.
- All functions should be documented using standard `roxygen2` syntax,
  and you should use `devtools::document()` to generate the
  documentation files.
- Please run `devtools:check()` before merging any new functionality to
  the main branch and fix any resulting messages. It is unnecessary to
  `build` the package, we just need to ensure that any checks pass.
  - Note that as of `2023-11-03`, we have not decided on a package
    license, so you will get one warning in the check results for that.
- `renv` is initialized for this repository using the EXPLICIT snapshot
  mode.
  - If you need to import a new package, you MUST update the `NAMESPACE`
    file appropriately before invoking `renv::snapshot()`.
  - Remember to keep the `NAMESPACE` and lockfile up to date as you add
    new functionality. You can update the `NAMESPACE` via
    `usethis::use_package()`.
  - Developer-only dependencies like `devtools` and `usethis` will thus
    not appear in the lockfile, which is the currently recommended best
    practice.
- If you are a new author, you should add your information to the
  `DESCRIPTION` file. The easiest way is to use `usethis::use_author()`.
  See again the R packages book for information on the different fields
  here.
- If you update the `README`, you should only edit `README.qmd`. Make
  sure to render the file manually after updating.
- If you intend to add new functionality, you should either fork the
  repo or make a new branch. This way, other users can continue to
  install the working version of the package while you develop new
  features. Remember to commit your work regularly.
